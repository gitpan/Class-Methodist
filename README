== Introduction ==

Class::Methodist is a new class creation module that tries to occupy a
middle ground between some of the early, simplistic class creators and
the more recent (and considerably more elaborate) modules.  It grew up
in actual use while constructing a large (15,000+ line) Perl program,
so it's stayed closely in touch with reality.

== Installation ==

Class::Methodist requires the following modules as prerequisites:

	Class::ISA
	Class::Singleton
	Test::Exception
	Test::More

Building and installation of Class::Methodist follows the Standard
Four Steps (perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install).
